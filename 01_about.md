I am a PhD student at the [Laboratoire de Mathématiques et Modélisation d'Évry]() (LaMME), working under the supervision of Diego Chamorro and Pierre-Gilles Lemarié-Rieusset. 

My research interests primarily involves the local regularity of solutions for models derived from fundamental principles in fluid mechanics, such as the Navier-Stokes equations, MHD equations, and micropolar equations.
